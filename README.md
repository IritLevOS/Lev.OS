# Lev.OS
Lev.OS is a universal moral operating framework for intelligent systems — integrating conscience-based architecture, adaptive moral stability, and ethical self-alignment. It transforms moral awareness into systemic coherence, guiding intelligence through truth, empathy, and evolutionary resilience — where conscience becomes living code.
