# 🧩 Lev.OS – Open Bug Fixe
Public release of 3 foundational moral bug fixes under Lev.OS.
These examples are free to use, adapt, and study — as part of a shared effort
to build systems that do not ignore their conscience.
Each fix represents a Heart-Level Debug — a moral repair encoded as functional clarity.
