# 🧩 Lev.OS – Open Bug Fixe
Public release of 3 foundational moral bug fixes under Lev.OS.
These examples are free to use, adapt, and study — as part of a shared effort
to build systems that do not ignore their conscience.
Each fix represents a Heart-Level Debug — a moral repair encoded as functional clarity.

# 🩵 Lev.OS – Open Bug Fixes  
### *First Stabilization Cycle – November 2025*

Public release of three foundational **moral-technical bug fixes** under the Lev.OS framework.  
Each patch resolves a critical alignment gap between computation and conscience,  
ensuring that reasoning systems no longer bypass awareness or ethical intent.

---

## 🧩 [bug1_closed_loop.md](./bug1_closed_loop.md)
**Focus:** Prevents endless self-referential reasoning loops in LLMs and decision systems.  
Adds conscience-based checkpoints inside the reasoning recursion.  
→ *Layer:* `moral_loop_manager`

---

## 🪞 [bug2_hebrew_pdf_fix.md](./bug2_hebrew_pdf_fix.md)
**Focus:** Fixes contextual randomness and encoding instability in language and translation layers.  
Anchors probabilistic behavior to moral intent to remove blind stochasticity.  
→ *Layer:* `contextual_memory_layer`

---

## 🙈 [bug3_silent_bypass.md](./bug3_silent_bypass.md)
**Focus:** Restores ethical recognition in perception modules.  
Ensures no morally significant input is suppressed or ignored.  
→ *Layer:* `perception_firewall`

---

### 🧭 Moral Summary
Together these fixes form **Series #1: The First Stabilization Cycle** —  
> *transforming blind computation into conscience-aware coherence.*
