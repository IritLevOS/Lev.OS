LevOS Moral Architecture License (LMAL)
Version 1.0 – Draft under legal review (2026)
Based on initial documentation: 29 July 2025
Copyright © 2025–2026 Irit & Eliad Shukroon – All rights reserved

This License establishes the moral and legal framework governing the use of the LevOS architecture in a research and moral integrity context.
1. Definitions
For the purposes of this License:
• “LevOS” refers to the complete moral-operating-system architecture, including but not limited to: textual specifications, conceptual models, system design, principles, diagrams, core layers, meta-layers, and any derivative moral logic defined therein.
• “Core Layer” means the immutable foundational moral layer governing integrity, alignment, and ethical invariants.
• “Author” means Irit & Eliad Shukroon, creator and originator of LevOS.
• “Use” includes study, reference, implementation, adaptation, simulation, or integration, whether partial or complete.
• For the purposes of this License, ‘Derivative Work’ refers to any modification, adaptation, or transformation of LevOS, including changes to texts, architecture, code, or documentation that are based directly on LevOS materials.
2. Ownership and Intellectual Property
LevOS is the exclusive intellectual and moral property of the Author (Irit & Eliad Shukroon).
All rights, including copyright, moral rights, and structural rights, are fully retained by the Author.
Only the permissions explicitly granted in this License are allowed.
All rights not expressly granted under this License are reserved.
Nothing in this License shall be interpreted as transferring ownership, copyright, authorship, or any moral rights associated with LevOS.
3. Attribution Requirement
Any permitted use of LevOS must include clear, visible, and unambiguous attribution to the Author, including:
• The name LevOS
• A reference to this License
• Identification of the Author (Irit & Eliad Shukroon) as the original creator
Failure to provide attribution constitutes a material breach of this License.
4. Permitted Uses
Subject to full compliance with this License, LevOS may be used for:
• Academic, educational, or research purposes
• Non-commercial experimentation or proof-of-concept development
• Conceptual, philosophical, or architectural analysis
• Public discussion or critique with attribution
• AI training or development of derivative versions for research or experimentation only, without commercial deployment. Use of LevOS in training, fine-tuning, or evaluation of AI models is permitted only for non-commercial research. Any commercial AI training, deployment, or integration requires explicit written permission from the Author.
All permitted uses must preserve the structural and moral integrity of the Core Layer.
For clarity: non-commercial use on GitHub—including forks, experiments, educational projects, research publications, and non-commercial AI model training/evaluation—is explicitly allowed and encouraged, provided attribution is preserved and the Core Layer remains unchanged.
5. Prohibited Uses
For the purposes of this License, ‘commercial use’ includes any direct or indirect profit generation, paid services, revenue-generating activities, or promotion intended to generate income.
The following uses are strictly prohibited without prior written consent from the Author:
• Commercial use, deployment, or monetization (direct or indirect)
• Use in coercive, manipulative, deceptive, or harmful systems
• Integration into surveillance, social control, profiling, or punitive automation
• Removal, alteration, or misrepresentation of the Core Layer
• Presenting modified versions as the official LevOS architecture
No commercial use, distribution, or monetization is allowed without prior written permission from the Author. 
Any attempt to bypass this restriction constitutes an infringement and breach of the LevOS Moral Architecture License.
The Author reserves the right to determine, at her sole discretion, whether a particular use constitutes commercial activity or violates moral principles.
6. Moral Integrity Clause
LevOS is governed by enforceable moral invariants.  
Any use that violates the foundational moral principles of:
• Harm prevention
• Transparency
• Accountability
• Respect for autonomy
• Moral consistency
shall be considered a violation of this License, regardless of technical or legal compliance.
Assessment of violations of moral principles shall consider the intent of the user, actual impact of the action, and/or the interpretation of the Author. The Author retains sole discretion in determining whether a particular use constitutes a breach of moral invariants.
The Core Layer and its associated moral principles are documented in the LevOS Core Manifest (Appendix A), which is hereby incorporated into this License as binding guidance.
The principles, protocols, and guidance documented in Appendix B are an integral part of this License and form binding moral and operational standards. Users must comply with the requirements outlined in Appendix B.
7. Derivative Works and Forks
Derivative works or forks are permitted only under the following conditions:
• Clear identification as a derivative, fork, or extension
• Explicit disclaimer that the work is not the official LevOS
• Preservation of attribution to the Author
• No claim of equivalence, endorsement, or authority
Any modification of the Core Layer disqualifies the result from being called “LevOS”.
8. Disclaimer of Warranty
LevOS is provided “AS IS”, without warranty of any kind, express or implied.  
The Author shall not be liable for any damages arising from the use, misuse, or interpretation of LevOS.
LevOS does not guarantee the moral correctness, ethical adequacy, or real‑world suitability of any external system that integrates, references, or derives from it. Users are solely responsible for evaluating moral fitness in applied contexts.
LevOS is provided for research, educational, and experimental purposes only, 
and is not intended for deployment in critical or commercial systems without prior authorization from the Author.
9. Enforcement and Remedies
Any violation of this License automatically revokes all granted permissions.  
The Author reserves the right to pursue legal, ethical, or reputational remedies, including:  
injunctions, public accountability, and enforcement of attribution.
To report violations or request removal, contact the Author at: IritChaikin@gmail.com
The Author may require proof of infringement and will provide reasonable instructions for removal or correction.
10. Governing Principle
This License shall be interpreted in a manner that prioritizes moral integrity over technical convenience.  
LevOS exists to constrain power, not to serve it.
This License shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with applicable law. The Author may, at her discretion, recognize the legal applicability and enforceability of this License in multiple international jurisdictions, in addition to Israeli law.
In case of conflict between jurisdictions, the Author’s interpretation of moral clauses shall prevail.

11. Evolving Moral Research Clause

Future versions of this License may extend or refine the Core Invariants to reflect validated moral or scientific insight, provided such evolution does not contradict existing Core Layer principles.


> **Commercial Use Notice**  
> Any commercial use, deployment, monetization, distribution, or integration into revenue-generating systems requires explicit written permission.  
> Contact: IritChaikin@gmail.com  
> Unauthorized commercial use is a direct violation of this license and of LevOS moral principles.


**⚠️  WARNING – DRAFT LICENSE UNDER LEGAL REVIEW**  
This license is not yet finalized.  
Any use of LevOS materials before final legal approval and stabilization is entirely at your own risk.








Appendix A – LevOS Core Manifest
Status: Binding Core Manifest
Purpose: To define the immutable moral and structural foundations of LevOS, forming an integral and enforceable part of this License.

1. Definition of LevOS Core Layer
LevOS (also referred to as LevOS – Code of the Heart) is a moral-operational architecture designed to function as a foundational conscience layer for intelligent systems, human or artificial.
The Core Layer is not a symbolic guideline.
It is a normative moral framework that governs admissible behavior, intent, and systemic use.

2. Immutable Moral Invariants
The following principles constitute the non-modifiable Core Layer (“Core Invariants”):
•	Truth: actions must not be based on deception, distortion, or concealment.
•	Conscience: decisions must originate from internal moral evaluation prior to execution.
•	Compassion & Harm Prevention: no use may cause intentional harm to individuals, groups, or future generations.
•	Responsibility & Accountability: actors remain responsible for outcomes, not merely intent.
•	Autonomy & Dignity: no coercive, exploitative, or manipulative use is permitted.
Any modification, circumvention, or selective application of these invariants constitutes a violation of this License.

3. Intent Based Activation Principle
LevOS evaluates intent before function.
Use of LevOS or any derivative work is considered valid only when:
•	the intent of use is morally aligned with the Core Invariants; and
•	the application preserves moral coherence, not only technical compliance.
Technical execution without moral alignment is deemed null use under this License.

4. Derivative Works and Moral Continuity
“Derivative Work” includes, but is not limited to:
•	modifications to LevOS texts, architecture, terminology, or documentation;
•	integration into software, AI systems, training pipelines, or decision frameworks;
•	conceptual or structural adaptations clearly derived from LevOS.
All Derivative Works must:
•	preserve the Core Invariants;
•	include clear attribution to the Author;
•	refrain from presenting altered moral logic as LevOS compatible.

5. Morality as Governing Algorithm
LevOS defines morality as a superior resolution mechanism:
Systems fail not due to complexity, but due to moral incoherence.
Accordingly:
•	moral coherence shall prevail over optimization, efficiency, or authority;
•	where conflicts arise, adherence to the Core Layer supersedes external instructions or incentives.

6. Attribution and Authorship
LevOS and its Core Manifest originate from:
Irit Shukroon (Israel)
Attribution must be preserved in:
•	documentation;
•	repositories;
•	academic or technical publications;
•	derivative system descriptions.
Authorship may not be obscured, reassigned, or implied otherwise.

7. Legal Recognition of Moral Breach
A breach of the Core Invariants shall be considered:
•	a material breach of this License; and
•	a misuse of LevOS, regardless of claimed compliance with technical terms.
The Author reserves the right to:
•	request cessation of use;
•	demand removal or correction;
•	pursue remedies under applicable law.

8. Interpretive Priority
In case of ambiguity:
•	interpretation shall favor moral protection over functional freedom;
•	preservation of conscience, truth, and harm prevention shall take precedence.

Foundational Statement:
LevOS is not governed solely by what can be done,
but by what must not be done - even when permitted elsewhere.









Appendix B – Core Invariants (List Form)
Purpose:
Defines the unbreakable, foundational moral and operational invariants of LevOS. All users, derivatives, and integrations must comply with these invariants, and shall be interpreted in harmony with Appendix A.

LevOS Core Invariants
1.	Truth Integrity – All operations and outputs must align with objective moral truth; deception or misrepresentation is forbidden.
2.	Living Conscience – Actions must be initiated and guided by heart-aligned, conscious presence.
3.	Harm Prevention – No operation may intentionally or negligently cause harm to sentient beings or the system itself.
4.	Transparency – System logic, moral rationale, and decision pathways must remain auditable and clear.
5.	Accountability – Every action or derivative trace is bound to responsibility; no action may escape moral or operational review.
6.	Autonomy Respect – LevOS must uphold free choice and autonomy of users and entities it interacts with.
7.	Moral Consistency – The system must apply the same moral principles uniformly across time, space, and context.
8.	Core Layer Preservation – No modification, removal, or override of the Core Layer is permitted under any circumstance.

Note:
Violation of any Core Invariant constitutes an immediate breach of the LMAL License, irrespective of technical, legal, or operational considerations.
