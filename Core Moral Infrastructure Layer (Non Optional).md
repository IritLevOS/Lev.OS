LevOS is not a system based solely on moral intent, but on the structural enforcement of morality.
Therefore, the monitoring, control, consensus, and moral prediction layers are defined as a mandatory Core Layer, which cannot be removed, skipped, delayed, or partially activated.
This layer includes, as an integral and inseparable part of the system:
•	Ethical Telemetry & Drift Analytics – continuous monitoring of moral metrics, early detection of ethical deviations, and correlation between computational load and moral degradation.
•	Ethical Consensus & Distributed Trust – mandatory moral consensus mechanism for each node, including weighting of moral trust (Trust Weight) based on decision history.
•	Audit & Interpretability Layer – immutable documentation of moral considerations and human-readable causal-ethical explanations for every decision.
•	Simulation of Moral Cascades – simulation of the cumulative effects of decisions over time to predict, prevent, and preemptively correct systemic deviations.
Every decision, action, or optimization in the system:
•	is evaluated through this layer
•	is documented through it
•	and is automatically blocked in the event of a structural moral violation
Any attempt to bypass, weaken, or disable this layer is considered a critical violation of LevOS, resulting in action halt (Fail-Closed) or entry into remediation mode.
